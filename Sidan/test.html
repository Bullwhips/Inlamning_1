                        <p>Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Released in
                            1967,
                            the LP
                            was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the
                            greatest
                            albums of all time. The album features Jimi Hendrix's innovative approach to songwriting and
                            electric
                            guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic and hard rock music.

                    The budget for the recordings was rather limited so Chas Chandler (producer) and Hendrix
                    completed
                    much
                    of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment.

                        <p>Axis: Bold as Love is the second studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Track Records
                            first
                            released it in the United Kingdom on December 1 1967, only seven months after the release of
                            the
                            group's highly successful debut, Are You Experienced. In the United States, Reprise Records
                            delayed
                            the release until the following month. The album reached the top ten in the album charts in
                            both
                            UK
                            and USA.</p>

                    Axis: Bold As Love's scheduled release date was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape
                    of
                    side
                    one
                    of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix,
                    Chas
                    Chandler,
                    and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session.

                    Hendrix stated that the cover would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his Native
                    American
                    heritage.

                    "Little Wing" is one of Hendrix's most popular songs, with interpretations recorded by musicians
                    in
                    a
                    variety of styles.
